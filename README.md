# Travel Tips

Travel Tips suggests a few interesting locations to visit based on the entered city name and shows the current weather in the city. 

### The challenge 

The Web app should be able to:
- Suggest the 10 best sights of a city entered by the user. (Suggestions from Foursquare API)
- the current weather report should also be displayed (OpenWeather API)

### Continued Development

- Better design for weather report
- Show covid-19 incidence rate by country
- Save user input to obtain statistics. e.g. the top 3 cities searched for.
